This dataset include data on technical regulations proposed at the national level by member states of the EU Single Market (including members of the Single Market that are not members of the EU) that are notified to the Commission under the 2015/1535 procedure. There is one observation per notified technical regulation (1988-2020). The dataset includes information on the start and end dates of the case, the member state that notified the proposed technical regulation, which third-party member states or institutions (if any) submitted comments and/or detailed opinions, and whether the Commission submitted a comment and/or detailed opinion.

\headerpage{comments\_net}{Comment-level network data}{30}{10}

\subheading{Description}

This dataset includes network data on comments. Network data is similar to directed dyad-year data except that it only includes directed dyad-years with at least one comment. For every year, there is one node per member state or institution that can submit a comment or notify a proposed technical regulation (only member states). Links can only exist between a third-party member state or institution that can submit a comment and a member state that can notify a technical regulation. There is a link between a third-party member state or institution and a notifying member state if and only if the former submitted at least one comment with respect to a technical regulation notified by the latter. The weight of the edge is the number of comments submitted. There is one observation per third-party member state or institution per notifying member state per year (2002-2020), excluding directed dyad-years where a state was not a member of the Single Market, but only if count of comments is positive.

\headerpage{opinions\_csts\_s}{Opinion-level cross-sectional time-series data by submitter}{30}{10}

\subheading{Description}

This dataset includes aggregated data on the number of detailed opinions submitted by each third-party member state or institution per year (cross-sectional time-series data). There is one observation per third-party member state or institution per year (1988-2020), excluding state-years where the state was not a member of the Single Market.

\headerpage{opinions\_ddy}{Opinion-level directed dyad-year data}{30}{10}

\subheading{Description}

This dataset includes aggregated data on the number of detailed opinions submitted by each third-party member state or institution against each notifying member state per year (directed dyad-year data). There is one observation per third-party member state or institution per notifying member state per year (2002-2020), excluding directed dyad-years where a state was not a member of the Single Market.

\headerpage{opinions\_net}{Opinion-level network data}{30}{10}

\subheading{Description}

This dataset includes network data on detailed opinions. Network data is similar to directed dyad-year data except that it only includes directed dyad-years with at least one detailed opinion. For every year, there is one node per member state or institution that can submit a detailed opinion or notify a proposed technical regulation (only member states). Links can only exist between a third-party member state or institution that can submit a detailed opinion and a member state that can notify a technical regulation. There is a link between a third-party member state or institution and a notifying member state if and only if the former submitted at least one detailed opinion with respect to a technical regulation notified by the latter. The weight of the edge is the number of detailed opinions submitted. There is one observation per third-party member state or institution per notifying member state per year (2002-2020), excluding directed dyad-years where a state was not a member of the Single Market, but only if count of comments is positive.
